## 2026-02-18 - [API Key Leakage in Error Logs]
**Vulnerability:** External API calls (like to Calendarific) include API keys in query parameters. When `fetch` fails, the error message often contains the full URL with the secret. This was being logged to `console.error`.
**Learning:** Default error logging for `fetch` operations can inadvertently expose secrets if they are part of the URL.
**Prevention:** Always redact sensitive query parameters from URLs before logging them. Wrap `fetch` calls in try-catch blocks to sanitize error messages before re-throwing or logging.
